## Day 37: Setting Up MySQL on a Virtual Machine in Azure

## Task Details:

The Nautilus DevOps team is tasked with integrating a PHP application hosted on an Azure VM with a MySQL database hosted on another Azure VM. This will validate the application's ability to connect to the database in the cloud.

- Create the MySQL VM:
   - Create a VM named `devops-mysql-vm` using the MySQL Jetware image from the Azure Marketplace.
   - Configure the VM in the `Central US` region.
   - Use `Password` as the authentication type.
   - Set the username as `devops_admin` and the password as `Namin@123456`
   - Allow `inbound` traffic on port `3306` to enable MySQL access.

- Setup the MySQL Database:
   - SSH into the `devops-mysql-vm`.
   - Use the `sudo /jet/enter mysql` command to access the MySQL shell.
   - Create a database named `devops_db`
   - Create a MySQL user named `devops_user` with password `password123`
   - Grant all privileges on the `devops_db` database to this user.

- PHP VM Setup:
   - A VM named `devops-php-vm` already exists in the `East US` region.
   - This VM is hosting a PHP application and contains a pre-existing `db_test.php` file in the `/var/www/html/` directory.

- Database Connection Configuration:
   - Retrieve the public IP address of the `devops-mysql-vm`
   - Update the database connection settings in the `db_test.php` file to use the MySQL credentials and public IP address of the `devops-mysql-vm`

Validation:

- Access the `db_test.php` file from the `devops-php-vm` using its public IP address

- Ensure the file displays the message `Connected successfully`, confirming the connection between the `PHP application` and the `MySQL database`.

## Steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2. From the Virtual Network dashboard, click on create button

3. On the Basics tab, enter the VM name and select the appropriate region.
4. Select the MySQL Jetware image from the Azure Marketplace

7.  SSH into `devops-mysql-vm` and Set Up the Database \
   `ssh devops_admin@<MYSQL_VM_PUBLIC_IP>`

8. Once inside the VM, run these commands:
```
# Access the MySQL shell via Jetware
sudo /jet/enter mysql

# Inside MySQL shell — run the following SQL commands:
CREATE DATABASE devops_db;

CREATE USER 'devops_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON devops_db.* TO 'devops_user'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

exit;
```
9. SSH into the PHP VM and update the config file `db_test.php file` \
    `ssh azureuser@<PHP_VM_PUBLIC_IP>`
10.  Edit the `db_test.php` file \
    `sudo vi /var/www/html/db_test.php`
11. Replace the contents of `db_test.php` with:
```
<?php
$servername = "<MYSQL_VM_PUBLIC_IP>";   // Public IP of devops-mysql-vm
$username   = "devops_user";
$password   = "password123";
$dbname     = "devops_db";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>
```

12. Save and exit
13. Validate the connection, Open a web browser and navigate to:
    `<PHP_VM_PUBLIC_IP>/db_test.php`
