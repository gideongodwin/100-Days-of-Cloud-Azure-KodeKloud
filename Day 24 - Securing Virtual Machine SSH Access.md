## Day 24: Day 24: Securing Virtual Machine SSH Access

#### Task Details:
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up a new Virtual Machine (VM) on the Azure cloud that can be accessed securely from their landing host (azure-client). Follow the steps below to complete this task:
- Create an SSH Key: On the azure-client host, check if an SSH key already exists. If it doesn’t exist, create a new SSH key on the `azure-client` host that will be used for password-less SSH access.
- Create a Virtual Machine: Use the `Azure Portal` or `Azure CLI` to create a new Virtual Machine named `datacenter-vm` in the `westus` region. Set the VM size to `Standard_B1s` and configure the VM with SSH access for the azureuser account using the newly created SSH key.
- Configure SSH Access: Ensure that the SSH key from the `azure-client` host is added to the azureuser account on datacenter-vm, enabling secure, password-less SSH access from the azure-client host.
- Verify Connectivity: Test the connection from azure-client to datacenter-vm using SSH to confirm that password-less access has been set up correctly

#### STEPS
1. Generate the SSH Key
  `ssh-keygen`
  `cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

2. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

3. From the Azure portal dashboard, Click on Virtual Machines and Create.
