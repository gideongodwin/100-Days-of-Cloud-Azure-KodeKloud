## Day 21 - Assigning Public IP to Virtual Machines

## Task Details

The Nautilus DevOps Team has received a new request from the Development Team to set up a new Azure Virtual Machine (VM). This VM will be used to host a new application that requires a stable public IP address. To ensure that the VM has a consistent public IP, a Static Public IP address needs to be associated with it. The VM will be named `devops-vm` and the Static Public IP will be named `devops-pip`
This setup will help the Development Team to have a reliable and consistent access point for their application.

- Create an Azure VM named `devops-vm` using any available Ubuntu image, with the VM size `Standard_B1s`

- Generate an SSH public key on the `azure-client` host and associate it with the VM for SSH access

- Associate a Static Public IP address named `devops-pip` with this VM

- Ensure the VM is accessible via SSH using the generated public key
